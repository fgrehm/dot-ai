description: "Structured project inception through interview, documentation, and scaffolding. Use when starting a new project (CLI tools, libraries, web apps, backends, etc.) to conduct a detailed interview about vision/scope/tech, generate foundational documentation (README with philosophy, CLAUDE.md for AI context, ROADMAP for phased plan), and scaffold initial code structure with git setup. Adapts questions and outputs based on project type."

# Project Inception

## Overview

This skill guides the creation of new projects through a structured inception process. Rather than jumping straight to code, it captures the project's vision, philosophy, architecture decisions, and build plan in documentation before writing a line of code.

The workflow:
1. **Interview** - Ask clarifying questions about the project (adapted by type)
2. **Document** - Generate README (with philosophy), CLAUDE.md (for AI context), and ROADMAP (phased plan)
3. **Scaffold** - Create initial directory structure and git setup with commits

## Quick Start

**Triggering this skill:**
- User says "start a new project" or "help me inception this project"
- User provides a project idea/description and asks for help structuring it
- User wants documentation and planning before diving into code

**Basic flow:**
1. Ask what type of project (or infer from description)
2. Run the interview for that project type (see "The Interview" section)
3. Generate documentation based on interview responses
4. Optional: scaffold initial code structure

## The Interview

The interview is the heart of inception. It captures:
- **What** the project is and who it's for
- **Why** it exists (philosophy, problem it solves)
- **How** it's built (tech stack, architecture decisions)
- **When** it ships (MVP scope, roadmap phases)

### Project Type Detection

First, determine the project type. This shapes which interview questions are asked:

- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface, single executable, focus on user interaction and command structure
- **Library**: Reusable package for other projects, public API, versioning matters
- **Web App**: Browser-based UI, backend, frontend, deployment
- **Backend Service**: API/service for other services to consume, scalability/monitoring
- **Personal Tool**: For one person's use, filesystem-native, privacy-conscious, lower production needs

Ask: "What type of project is this?" If unclear, infer from the description.

### Interview Questions

See [references/interview_questions.md](references/interview_questions.md) for the complete question list organized by project type.

**Generic approach:**
- Start with high-level questions (vision, problem, users)
- Follow with tech/architecture questions
- End with MVP and roadmap questions
- Adapt based on responses (ask follow-ups, skip irrelevant questions)

**Keep it conversational:** These aren't a rigid quiz. Ask natural follow-ups, skip questions if already answered, reword for clarity.

### Summarizing Interview Responses

After the interview, summarize what you learned:

```
Project: [Name]
Type: [CLI/Library/Web App/etc.]
Vision: [1-2 sentence purpose]
Tech Stack: [Languages, frameworks, deployment]
MVP Scope: [What ships first]
Key Philosophy: [Unique approach/constraint]
```

This becomes the foundation for documentation generation.

## Documentation Generation

Generate three core documents from interview responses:

### 1. README.md

**Structure:**
- Title and tagline
- "What is this?" section
- Philosophy/principles section
- Architecture overview
- MVP features
- Tech stack (table format)
- Open questions
- Development status

See [references/documentation_templates.md](references/documentation_templates.md#readme) for full template.

### 2. CLAUDE.md

**Structure:**
- "What this is" summary
- Tech stack
- Directory layout (XDG Base Directory Spec if applicable)
- Architecture decisions
- MVP scope
- Code style guidelines
- Standards and conventions
- Repository info

See [references/documentation_templates.md](references/documentation_templates.md#claudemd) for full template.

**Key principle:** CLAUDE.md is for future AI assistants. Write it as a context document that helps Claude understand the project without needing to explore the codebase.

### 3. ROADMAP.md

**Structure:**
- Phased plan (Phase 1: Foundation, Phase 2: Core features, Phase 3+: Polish/Beyond MVP)
- Within each phase, numbered items with dependencies
- "Suggested build order" section listing the critical path

See [references/documentation_templates.md](references/documentation_templates.md#roadmap) for full template.

## Tech-Specific Scaffolding

After documentation, optionally scaffold code structure based on tech stack.

**When to scaffold:**
- User asks for it
- Project has clear scaffolding patterns (CLI with Cobra, React app, Python library)
- MVP is defined and ready to start

**Common patterns:**

- **Go CLI with Cobra**: Create cmd/main.go, cmd/root.go, cmd/subcommands.go, Makefile
- **Python CLI**: Create pyproject.toml, src/package/__main__.py, tests/
- **Web App (React)**: Create frontend/, backend/, package.json/go.mod, Dockerfile
- **Library (Go/Python)**: Create src/, tests/, docs/, example/, LICENSE

**Ask before scaffolding:** "Should I create the initial code structure?" - don't assume.

## Standards and Conventions

Always follow established standards. See [references/standards_checklist.md](references/standards_checklist.md) for the full checklist.

Key ones:
- **XDG Base Directory Spec** for file paths (when applicable)
- **Conventional Commits** for git messages
- **ISO 8601** for dates and timestamps
- **YAML** for config files
- **JSONL** for logs
- OpenAI-compatible APIs, OpenGraph for metadata, etc.

## Git Setup

Initialize git repo and create initial commits:

1. `git init`
2. Add docs: `git add README.md CLAUDE.md ROADMAP.md`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "docs: add project README, CLAUDE.md, and ROADMAP with initial spec"`
4. If scaffolded code: `git add <code files>` and commit with appropriate message

Use Conventional Commits format (feat, fix, chore, docs, etc.) in commit messages.

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
START: "Help me inception a new project"
  ├─ Ask: "What type of project?"
  │   ├─ [CLI Tool] → Use CLI interview
  │   ├─ [Library] → Use Library interview
  │   ├─ [Web App] → Use Web App interview
  │   ├─ [Backend] → Use Backend interview
  │   └─ [Personal Tool] → Use Personal Tool interview
  ├─ Run the interview for that type (ask questions, listen for answers)
  ├─ Summarize responses
  ├─ Generate README, CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP
  ├─ Ask: "Should I scaffold initial code?"
  │   ├─ [Yes] → Create code structure
  │   └─ [No] → Skip to git setup
  ├─ Initialize git repo and make initial commits
  └─ END: "Your project is ready to build!"
```

## Tips

- **Don't over-engineer the interview.** If the user has already decided on tech, scope, and philosophy, skip those questions.
- **Write docs as if explaining to a future self.** Imagine opening this project 6 months from now with no context - would these docs help?
- **Philosophy matters.** The README philosophy section captures why the project exists. Spend time on this.
- **CLAUDE.md is critical.** This is what keeps AI assistants productive in future sessions. Include architecture decisions, not just tech stack.
- **Roadmap phases should be actionable.** "Phase 1: Foundation" is better than "Phase 1: Setup stuff." Name the actual components being built.
