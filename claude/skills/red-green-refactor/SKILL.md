# Red-Green-Refactor

A structured implementation loop that produces clean, tested, committed code in two
phases: first make it work (green + commit), then make it right (refactor + commit).

## Phase 0: Discovery

Before writing code, establish the project's verification commands. Check the project
root for Makefile, package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, go.mod, etc.

Identify and confirm with the user:
- **Build**: how to compile/typecheck (e.g., `make build`, `go build ./...`, `tsc`)
- **Test**: how to run tests (e.g., `make test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`)
- **Lint**: how to lint (e.g., `make lint`, `eslint .`, `golangci-lint run`)

If any command is missing, note it and proceed without it. Use a task list to track
progress through the phases.

## Phase 1: Green

Goal: working code with passing tests.

1. **Read before writing.** Read every file you intend to modify. Understand existing
   patterns, naming conventions, and test styles before changing anything.
2. **Implement incrementally.** Work in small, compilable steps. Run build after each
   logical chunk to catch errors early rather than accumulating a big-bang diff.
3. **Write tests alongside code.** For new public functions/types, add tests in the
   same pass. Match the project's existing test style and naming.
4. **Verify green state.** Run build + test + lint. Fix any failures. Do not proceed
   until all three pass cleanly.

## Phase 2: Commit (green)

Lock in the working state. Stage only the files you changed. Write a conventional
commit message that describes the feature, not the implementation mechanics.

## Phase 3: Refactor

Goal: reduce duplication, improve structure, without changing behavior.

1. **Analyze systematically.** Use an Explore agent to scan the changed files and their
   neighbors for:
   - Duplicated logic that could be shared
   - Functions that are too long or do too many things
   - Dead code, unused exports, unnecessary abstractions
   - Inconsistent patterns (error handling, naming, structure)
   - Integration seams or awkward bridging between old and new code
   - Performance issues (unnecessary allocations, missing reuse)
2. **Prioritize.** Group findings into high/medium/low priority. High = duplicated code,
   real bugs, performance issues. Medium = readability, consistency. Low = stylistic,
   future-proofing. Present the list to the user and get approval on scope.
3. **Implement top-down.** Work through approved items from high to low priority. After
   each change, verify build + test + lint still pass.
4. **Stop when diminishing returns.** If remaining items are low-priority and the code
   is clean, stop. Document deferred items somewhere discoverable (e.g., in a spec,
   TODO comments, or an issue tracker).

## Phase 4: Commit (refactor)

Same as Phase 2. The commit message should start with `refactor:` or `refactor(scope):`
and summarize what was cleaned up.

## Guardrails

- **Never skip verification.** Every phase boundary (green, refactor) must pass
  build + test + lint before committing.
- **Never combine green and refactor in one commit.** The point of two commits is that
  the first is a known-good checkpoint. If refactoring breaks something, you can revert
  to the green commit.
- **Never refactor without approval.** Present the analysis and let the user pick which
  items to address. Some "improvements" aren't worth the churn.
- **Keep refactoring behavior-preserving.** If a refactoring item changes behavior (e.g.,
  fixing a bug found during analysis), call it out explicitly and get confirmation.
